## CMA-ES ##

This is a minimal implementation of the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy optimization algorithm.

>Evolution strategies (ES) are stochastic, derivative-free methods for numerical optimization of non-linear or non-convex continuous optimization problems. They >belong to the class of evolutionary algorithms and evolutionary computation. An evolutionary algorithm is broadly based on the principle of biological evolution, >namely the repeated interplay of variation (via mutation and recombination) and selection: in each generation (iteration) new individuals (candidate solutions, >denoted as x) are generated by variation, usually in a stochastic way, and then some individuals are selected for the next generation based on their fitness or >objective function value f(x).
